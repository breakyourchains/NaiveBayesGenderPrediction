  The project was initiated to design a model capable of predicting transaction amounts within the existing data. However, upon examining the data, it was found that the gender labels in the data were incorrect, and it was anticipated that these incorrect gender labels would affect the predictions based on gender. There are missing data points within the dataset, and when incorrect data is considered, the gender data has become unreliable to a significant extent. As a result, the goal is to completely rectify the gender data by re-predicting it using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
  Data consisting of nearly 150,000 first names and last names were used for training purposes. Significantly successful results were achieved in this training, and gender predictions showed a noticeable improvement compared to previous data. The data was organized and made suitable for training. The reason for choosing Naive Bayes in this training is that various models were experimented with for text data and prediction-based data, and Naive Bayes was selected as the most suitable and successful model.
